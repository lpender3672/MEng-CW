\subsection{Objectives}

\section{Development of Software Tool}

\subsection{Panel Method}

Many of the panel method functions could be vectorized to improve performance.
\subsubsection{Single Panel}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/single_panel.jpg}
    \caption{Single Panel}
    \label{fig:single_panel}
\end{figure}
The streamfunction due to a linearly distributed vortex panel is given by
\begin{equation}
    \psi(X,Y) = \gamma_a f_a + \gamma_b f_b
\end{equation}
where $f_a$ and $f_b$ are influence coefficients of the panel at points $a$ and $b$ respectively.
The influence functions can be found by integrating the Biot-Savart law over the panel.

A function is written to calculate the influence coefficients for a vector of panel points.


\subsection{Boundary Layer Solver}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{figures/bl_solver_flowchart.png}
    \caption{Boundary Layer Profile}
    \label{fig:BL}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Laminar Regime}

Test for transition to turbulence
\begin{equation}
    \ln(Re_\theta) = 18.4 H_E - 21.74 \quad \text{ where } \quad Re_\theta = Re_L\left( \frac{u_e}{U} \right) \left( \frac{\theta}{L} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    m = - \frac{\theta^2}{\mu}\frac{du_e}{dx} = -Re_L \left( \frac{\theta}{L} \right)^2 \frac{d(u_e / U)}{d(x/L)}
\end{equation}

If $m > 0.09$, then the laminar boundary layer seperates and is treated as turbulent.

\subsubsection{Turbulent Regime}

\begin{equation}
    \dot{\mathbf{y}} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{d \theta}{d x} \\[5pt]
        \frac{d \delta_E}{d x}
    \end{bmatrix} = f(x,\mathbf{y}) = \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{c_f}{2} - \frac{H+2}{u_e}\frac{d u_e}{d x} \theta \\[5pt]
        c_\text{diss} - \frac{3}{u_e} \frac{d \delta_E}{d x} \delta_E
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
    H &= \begin{cases}
        \frac{11 H_E + 15}{48H_E - 59} & \text{if } H_E  \ge 1.46 \\
        2.803 & \text{if } H_E < 1.46
    \end{cases} \\
    c_f &= 0.091416\left[(H-1)Re_\theta \right]^{-0.232}e^{-1.26H} \\
    c_\text{diss} &= 0.010024\left[(H-1)Re_\theta \right]^{1/6}
\end{align}

\section{Topology Optimization}

\subsection{Changing Topology}

A spline fit tool is used to paramaterize complex curves with a small number of control points.
The calculated lift and drag coefficients are very sensitive to control point position.

A Naca 0012 airfoil is used as a starting point to gain insight into the effect of changing the airfoil shape on performance.

\subsection{Objective}

The objective is to maximize the lift to drag ratio of the airfoil at a range of angles of attack.
It is important to consider a range of angles of attack for the airfoil for robust performance.
This is especially important for 3D wings as it ensures that tip stall is less likely for twist distrubtions from lifting line theory.

Two Reynolds numbers are considered, $Re = 20\times10^6$ and $Re = 5\times10^5$


\subsection{High Reynolds Number}

The first changes made to the initial NACA 0012 airfoil were increasing curvature of the top surface.
This was done first all along the airfoil, then only in the region of the leading edge.
This can be seen below in figure \ref{fig:v5_geometry} and the performance in figure \ref{fig:v5_lod}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/hiRe_geometry_5.eps}
    \caption{Airfoil Geometry of first 5 design iterations}
    \label{fig:v5_geometry}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth, center]{figures/hiRe_lod_5.eps}
        \caption{Airfoil}
        \label{fig:v5_lod}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.54\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/hiRe_upperprofile_5_a5.eps}
        \caption{Pressure coefficient and momentum thickness profiles for $\alpha = 5^\circ$}
        \label{fig:v5_uprofile}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Performance of initial 5 design iterations and their upper surface boundary layer profiles}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:v5_uprofile} shows that these changes have a significant effect on the shape of the suction peak.
For maximum lift the area enclosed by the upper surface pressure coefficient profile should be minimised.
This means that the suction peak area should be maximised.
Version 2 had a 10\% higher lift coefficient which resulted in a higher lift to drag ratio seen in figure \ref{fig:v5_lod}.
All of versions 3 4 and 5 consisted of variations of the leading edge curvature which had worse lift to drag ratios.
This did move the suction peak further back along the upper surface but due to an increased gradient behind the peak,
the area enclosed by the profile was decreased overall.
A thinner version 5 produced a lift coefficient 11\% lower than the initial NACA 0012 airfoil.

Changes were then made to upper surface to ensure its convex to prevent adverse pressure gradients and increase area enclosed by the suction peak.
This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:v9_geometry} and the performance in figure \ref{fig:v9_lad}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/hiRe_geometry_9.eps}
    \caption{Airfoil Geometry}
    \label{fig:v9_geometry}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth, center]{figures/hiRe_lad_9.eps}
        \caption{Airfoil}
        \label{fig:v9_lad}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}{0.54\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/hiRe_upperprofile_9_a3.eps}
        \caption{Pressure coefficient and momentum thickness profiles for $\alpha = 3^\circ$}
        \label{fig:v9_uprofile}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Performance of design iterations 6-9 and their upper surface boundary layer profiles}
\end{figure}

This change shows a higher lift achieved as the low pressure coefficient is maintained by the convex upper surface.
The drag coefficient curves for many designs in figure \ref{fig:v9_lad} show a sudden increase at varying angles of attack.
This is due to the point of transition to turbulence jumping forward on the upper surface with the increased angle of attack.
An earlier transition point means that the boundary layer can grow to be significantly thicker, increasing the drag of the aerofoil.
However, the NACA0012 demonstrates that early transition with small adverse pressure gradients can also produce lower drag coefficients.

Attempts were made to smooth the upper surface to prevent jumps in the transition point for a robust aerofoil design.
These can occur if there are too many closely spaced control points which can create a zig-zag shape, producing alternating favourable and adverse pressure gradients.
Small variations increasing the radius of curvature produced an even larger enclosed area by the suction peak and hence higher lift,
but at the cost of an increased pressure gradient behind the peak and hence higher drag (Versions 7 and 8).

Changes to the lower surface were then considered.
The lower surface was flattened to remove the adverse pressure gradient and increase pressure coefficient on the bottom surface to increase lift.

This improved pressure on the bottom surface and moved transition along which is two desired effects.
Also improved the lift generated on the top surface in a relatively unexpected manner since we didn't change this.
idea moves stagnation point down which increases streamline curvature around top and achieves lower cp on top (more lift)

Changed lower trailing edge to be a tiny bit convex and it was previously concave. 
Approaching concave we get favourable pressure gradient helping to move transition along. 
At concave part we get higher pressures (which for bottom surface increases lift).
Boundary layer turbulent at this point and isn't too badly affected at end. 
Trying to extend concavity further we increased drag as transition occurred earlier. (Approached adverse pressure gradient sooner)

\end{figure}

Changes to extend the concavity closer to the leading edge saw reductions in drag for V15 and V16.
V17 extended the concavity further but also increased the curvature and introduced a bump with adverse pressure gradient causing early transition and increased drag.
This causes natural transition to occur much later as a favourable pressure gradient was maintained for longer.
The increased curvature also increases pressure coefficient on the lower surface, increasing the lift.

Versions 14 and 16 featured another sudden change in drag, this time a decrease at lower angles of attack.
This was found to be due to a higher stagnation point above the leading edge, which meant that the flow had to turn more sharply around the leading edge.
This caused the boundary layer to transition close to the leading edge and hence the drag to decrease.
This size of the jump was reduced and moved to lower angles of attack by decreasing the curvature of the lower surface near the leading edge.

The best design achieves so far is V16 with a maximum lift to drag ratio of 160.
The next aim was to remove the bump on the lower surface that caused a region of adverse pressure gradient
which caused early transition and increased drag in V17.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Performance of design iterations 14-17 and their upper surface boundary layer profiles}
\end{figure}

In V20 design the path length of the top surface increased as we moved it up slightly.
This resulted in increased lift and drag.
The increased length caused the momentum thickness to grow more, increasing drag.
The suction peak widened and gave more area and so produced more lift.

V21. The curvature of the leading edge was increased which means that the flow can turn around with a smaller adverse pressure gradient.
This means higher angle of attacks can be reached, with lower stagnation points before the corner of the leading edge is sharp enough to cause early transition.
This is demonstrated by the jump in drag occurring at higher AoA.


\subsection{Low Reynolds Number}

\end{figure}

Laminar seperation and turbulent reattachment was found to occur on the lower surface for initial designs.
Designs with this front seperation bubble forced transition to turbulent flow early instead of laminar seperation at the end.
Seperation at the end of the foil where boundary layer is thicker caused a significant growth in the boundary layer and hence drag.
Additionally forcing the boundary layer to be turbulent means improved tolerance of adverse pressure gradients and so higher pressure coefficients may be reached.
This was exploited in Marks 9 and 12 where the lower surface was made more concave to increase lift at the cost of increased drag.

An attempt was made to move the seperation bubble further back by decreasing the curvature of the bump and adverse pressure gradient behind the bump.

The lift slightly increased and the drag significantly decreased.
This removed the front seperation bubble, similar to Mark 5 of figure \ref{fig:m12_lprofile} with separation occuring near trailing edge.
However the drag was much lower than Mark 5 due to reduced adverse pressure gradient from reduced curvature at the trailing edge.
This was found to significantly increase the lift to drag ratio suggesting that the bubble, although it gave better performance than the original NACA0012, was not an optimal aerofoil.

Changes made to marks 13, 15 and 16 were done to push the seperation bubble further back and reduce the adverse pressure gradients to reduce drag.
This involved increasing radius of curvature of the bump and 
were shaped to be even thicker aerofoils to achieve a larger curve radius which successfully pushed back the separation bubble, at the cost of increased length for boundary layer growth.
These changes were found to be very sensitive and so it may not be possible to push the upper surface separation point as far back as the lower surface.

\end{figure}

Design marks 18 and 19 were shaped to be even thicker aerofoils to achieve a larger curve radius which successfully pushed back the separation bubble, at the cost of increased length for boundary layer growth.
This still provided a marginal improvement in drag but not enough to be further considered.

Mark 20 had reduced lower surface curvature close to the trailing edge in attempt to reduce the adverse pressure gradient and move seperation point further back.
This change only increased the gradient upstream and so resulted in loss of lift and increased drag.

Focus was then placed on moving the upper surface seperation bubble further back to reduce drag.
This was done by smoothing the top surface to decrease pressure gradients.

Result of changes TODO
Improvement over m21 still there but transition occurring on adverse p grad slightly earlier. 

Marks 24 and 25 consisted of more aggressive changes which ended up creating a suction at the start which performs poorly.

An attempt to fix this was made by continuing the curvature further.

This reduced the pressure on the top surface significantly increasing lift.
Mark 28 shows that the laminar separation bubble was pushed so far back that natural transition occurs instead.
This was expected to significantly reduce the drag, however, turbulent separation was now occurring sooner which increased the drag.
This was found to be due to a stronger adverse pressure gradient at the trailing edge.

Mark 29 featured reduction in curvature at the trailing edge, which delayed transition but produced regions of initially larger, then smaller adverse pressure gradients.
This caused earlier turbulent separation but reduced turbulent boundary layer growth after separation to reach a smaller final momentum thickness, and hence drag.
Another marginal improvement was seen in the final design mark 30

\subsection{Bezier Spline Optimization}

Instead of manually changing the control points, a Bezier spline can be used to paramaterize the airfoil shape.
The x values of the control points were chosen to be equally spaced along the chord length, and the y values were to be optimised for.
There is a single constraint that the airfoil must not self-intersect.
Additional constraints were partially implemented such as minimum thickness due to the integrated lift bending moment of trailing edge.

It was interesting to note that for many manually selected initial conditions, the optimizer would converge to local maximum lift to drag ratios.
The optimizer was run for a large number of random initial conditions and a global maximum was found at a lift to drag ratio of.
