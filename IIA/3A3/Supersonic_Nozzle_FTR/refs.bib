    abstract = { Most of the experimental work in connection with the flow of fluids through diaphragm orifices in pipe lines has been directed to the establishment of the orifice as a flow meter, and has been carried out at the velocities of flow commonly encountered in commercial practice. As a result of such research the coefficients relating the volumetric discharge of incompressible fluids to the differential head across an orifice are well known over a large range of high Reynolds numbers. For a particular diameter ratio (i. e., orifice diameter ÷ diameter of pipe line) the discharge coefficient is nearly constant under conditions of turbulent flow. Over the range from steady to turbulent flow, however, very appreciable variations occur in the value of the discharge coefficient, suggest­ing that the accompanying variations in the nature of the flow through and beyond the orifice will be no less marked. As regards the turbulent flow pattern, an investigation, in which the author collaborated, of the airflow downstream of a flat plate suggests that an orifice in a pipe will in general give rise to a vortex system, probably having some points of resemblance to the well-known Kármán street which is a feature of the two-dimensional flow past a bluff obstacle, but doubtless exhibiting interesting differences arising from the symmetrical and three-dimensional character of the flow through an orifice. At sufficiently low Reynolds numbers, on the other hand, perfect flow free from periodic vorticity will occur. The stages connecting these two extreme conditions present many points of interest not only as regards the nature of the vortex system downstream of the orifice and the conditions of flow covering its inception, but also as regards the accom­panying pressure-velocity relation during the transition. }

abstract = {The precision of modern length interferometry and geodetic surveying far exceeds the accuracy, which is ultimately limited by the inadequacy of currently used equations for the refractive index of the atmosphere. I have critically reviewed recent research at the National Physical Laboratory, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and elsewhere that has led to revised formulas and data for the dispersion and density of the major components of the atmosphere. I have combined selected formulas from these sources to yield a set of equations that match recently reported measurements to within the experimental error, and that are expected to be reliable over very wide ranges of atmospheric parameters and wavelength.},
