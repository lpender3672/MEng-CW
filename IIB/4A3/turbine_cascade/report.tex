\section{Discussion}

\subsection{General}

\subsubsection{}
Assume isentropic flow to estimate the change of density from the measurements of
upstream and downstream static pressure. Can the flow be regarded as incompressible?

\begin{equation}
    \frac{P}{\rho^\gamma} = \text{const}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{}
Using the data you have acquired, evaluate the following quantities at the first
measurement point in your traverse, which should be in the freestream between the wakes

\subsubsection{}
the inlet velocity to the cascade,

\subsubsection{}
the exit velocity,

\subsubsection{}
the difference between the inlet and exit static pressures.

Explain why the velocity rises and the static pressure falls across the cascade.

\subsection{Exit Traverse}
\subsubsection{}

The script shows a series of graphs showing the normalised variation of the quantities

\begin{align*}
    \text{Stagnationg pressure loss} \quad & \frac{P_{01} - P_{02}}{P_{01} - P_{2,\text{av}}} \\
    \text{Static pressure} \quad & \frac{P_{1,\text{av}} - P_2}{P_{01} - P_{2,\text{av}}} \\
    \text{Exit velocity over isentropic velocity} \quad & \frac{V_2}{V_{2\text{s}}} \\
    \text{Exit yaw angle} \quad & \alpha_2
\end{align*}

across one pitch of the flow behind the blades. Note that the denominators as well as the
numerators in the coefficient correspond to measurements taken at the same time as the probe
pressures are taken. This minimises the effects of small changes in tunnel speed upon the data.

$P_{1,\text{av}}$ is the average of five cascade inlet endwall static pressure tappings shown in Fig. ?

$P_{2,\text{av}}$ is the average exit pressure from the cascade, in this experiment it is equal to the
atmospheric pressure

Explain why we use $(P_{01} - P_{2,\text{av}})$ as the denominator for the first two quantities above in
preference to $(P_{01} - P_{1,\text{av}})$ or $(P_{02} - P_{2,\text{av}})$?

Comment on the shape of all the curves and the magnitude of any variations. Explain the origin
of the important features

\subsubsection{}
The probe is used to measure the flow angle via the yaw coefficient defined as
\begin{equation}
    C_\text{yaw} = \frac{P_\text{left} - P_\text{right}}{P_0 - P}
\end{equation}
Explain how the initial calibration of the probe is used to determine the flow angle across the
pitch of the passage using the yaw coefficient. Over what range is the calibration valid?

\subsubsection{}
Besides the plots, the script also calculates various average quantities that are printed
to screen. One of these is the mass averaged stagnation pressure loss coefficient as defined by
% bibliography

\begin{equation}
    Y_p = \frac{p_{01} - \overline{p_{02}}}{p_{01} - p_{2,av}} = \frac{\int_{-s/2}^{s/2} \rho_2 V_{x2} \frac{p_{01} - p_{02}}{p_{01} - p_2} \, dy}{\int_{-s/2}^{s/2} \rho_2 V_{x,2} \, dy}
\end{equation}

Explain how mass averaging is used and in where it is appropriate to apply this treatment of
data reduction

\subsubsection{}
Use a control volume analysis and the average values from the exit traverse to determine
the axial and tangential force on a blade. Hence, evaluate the force coefficients

\begin{equation}
    Z_x = \frac{F_x}{0.5 \rho_2 V_2^2 h C_x} \quad \& \quad Z_y = \frac{F_y}{0.5 \rho_2 V_2^2 h C_x}
\end{equation}

where $h$ is the span of the blade and $C_x$ is the axial chord. Comment on the relative magnitudes
of $Z_x$ and $Z_y$. How would your answers change if the traverse plane were moved further
downstream? What role do viscous forces on the blades play in your analysis?

\subsubsection{}
The script evaluates the average pitchwise exit flow angle using the relationship
\begin{equation}
    \tan (\overline{\alpha}_2) = \frac{\text{y momentum at 2}}{\text{x momentum at 2}} = \frac{\rho V_{x,2}V_{y,2}}{\rho V_{x,2}^2}
\end{equation}
The inviscid flow calculation predicts that the exit flow angle should be $71.6^\circ$. Compare the
measured value of $\alpha_2$ the throat o, and the pitch s as

\begin{equation}
    \cos (\overline{\alpha}_2) = \frac{o}{s}
\end{equation}
Compare your measurements and the value given by this equation. Comment on any
differences.

\subsubsection{}
The axial velocity ratio of the cascade is determined from the equation
\begin{equation}
    AVR = \frac{\overline{V_{x,2}}}{V_{x,1}} = \frac{1}{s V_{x,1}} \int_{-s/2}^{s/2} V_{x,2} \, dy
\end{equation}

If the flow were truly two dimensional and truly incompressible, then the axial velocity ratio
would be unity since, at mid-span, the mass flow per unit area at inlet would be the same as
that at exit. Discuss whether density changes across the cascade are enough to describe any
differences to unity you observe and, if not, explain what else may be responsible?

\subsection{Blade Surface Pressure Distribution}

The same script will assist you with the reduction of the static pressure data.
\subsubsection{}
The script evaluates the static pressure coefficient $C_p$ and the isentropic velocity for
each of the pressure tappings on the blade surface. The coefficient $C_p$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
    C_p = \frac{P_{01} - P}{P_{01} - P_2}
\end{equation}

where P is the static pressure on the blade surface. The isentropic velocity
$V_s$, which may be
regarded as the velocity in the flow just outside the boundary layer, is normalised by the
isentropic exit velocity
$V_{2s}$ so that the ratio is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \frac{V_s}{V_{2s}} = \sqrt{\frac{P_{01} - P}{P_{01} - P_{2,av}}} = \sqrt{C_p}
\end{equation}
Mark the pressure and suction surfaces and any regions of adverse pressure gradient.

A prediction of the isentropic blade-surface velocity distribution with the cascade at its
design condition has been obtained using a boundary element CFD code. This solves the
equation for potential flow through the cascade. The prediction for the design condition is
reproduced by the script for comparison with the experimental data.

\subsubsection{}
Diffusion factors are often used in turbine design to quantify flow deceleration. It is
reasoned that profile losses in a turbine primarily depend on the amount of diffusion on the
suction surface. Hence, the most commonly used 'local' diffusion factor is defined as

\begin{equation}
    D = \frac{V_\text{max} - V_2}{V_\text{max}}
\end{equation}
where
$V_\text{max}$ is the maximum suction surface velocity and
$V_2$ is the exit velocity. Calculate the
diffusion factor, D, from your cascade measurements.

\subsubsection{}
On the plot of the velocity distribution, indicate the location of any separation lines seen
in the flow visualisation.

\subsubsection{}
Find the fraction by which the surface velocity has decreased from the maximum value
to the separation point. For a laminar boundary layer, this is typically 5-8%. For a turbulent
boundary layer, it is much more. What state is the boundary layer in at the trailing edge, laminar
or turbulent, separated or attached?

\subsubsection{}
Comment on any differences between the measured and predicted velocity
distributions.

\subsubsection{}
The script also integrates your measured pressure distribution to determine the pressure
blade force per unit span in the y-direction and x-direction. It then evaluates the force
coefficients $Z_x$ and $Z_y$ and these are printed to screen.

Compare the pressure blade force coefficients with the values indicated by the results of your
exit traverse and comment on any discrepancy.

\subsection{Effect of Reynolds number}

The Reynolds number is defined as
\begin{equation}
    Re = \frac{\rho V_2 C}{\mu}
\end{equation}

The script shows how the profile loss of the cascade varies with Reynolds number at an exit
Mach number of 0.8. These results were obtained when the same cascade hardware was tested
in the high-speed variable density tunnel at the Whittle Laboratory.

\subsubsection{}
Compare your measurements with the other values. What do you conclude about the
effect of Mach number?

\subsubsection{}
Figure 3 shows the results of flow visualisation experiments at high and low Reynolds
numbers. The effect of Reynolds number on the behaviour of the boundary layer can be seen
near the trailing edge. Suggest reasons for the shape of the relationship between loss and
Reynolds number that you plotted.


\subsection{Effect of Mach number}
The script shows surface isentropic Mach number distributions for this cascade at different
values of the nominal exit Mach number (M2 = 0.39 to 0.75). Comment on the variation of
diffusion factor with Mach number. Would these blades be more suitable for high or low Mach
numbers?
