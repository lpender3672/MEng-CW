\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

Waves are a fundamental part of physics with many different applications,
in the efficient transmission of information and energy. 
In this report, we will be looking at the transmission of waves through a medium, 
and how the transmission of waves can be affected by the medium.


\subsection{Aims}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To create and observe the effect of combining waves travelling in opposite directions - 
    which produces standing waves.
    \item To measure the wavelength and velocity of microwaves in air by observing standing waves
    in a coaxial line.
    \item To measure the velocity of microwaves in some solid material (e.g. teflon, perspex and
    glass) from the change in travel time when the material is substituted for air, and to
    characterise the material by its refractive index, n.
    \item To build a microwave resonator, by making a section line with highly reflective ends. To
    plot and interpret the response versus frequency for resonators of two different lengths.
    \item To identify sources of error in the instruments and procedures used, and to suggest
    improvements.
\end{itemize}

\section{Method}

\subsection{Apparatus}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Computer controlled microwave source
    \item Slotted Line - A fine probe can be moved along the line to measure the amplitudes of the waves at different points. The end of the line can be fitted with a short or open circuit to include reflections. Loads can also be added using a strip line.
    \item Strip Line - allows different materials to be introduced into the wave field space between the suspended live conductor and the ground plane.
    \item Data logger - to record amplitude at specific distances along the slotted line
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Wavelength and Phase Velocity of Standing Waves}

The short circuit plug at the end of the slotted line is fitted to produce standing waves in the line. The probe is moved along the line to find two positions of minima. The average distance between the minima is found and the wavelength is calculated. The phase velocity is then calculated from the wavelength and the frequency of the microwave source.

\subsection{Amplitude Reflection Coefficient}

The closed circuit plug has a amplitude reflection coefficient $\rho = -1$, However the reflection coefficient of the open circuit plug is not known.
The open circuit plug is fitted to the end of the slotted line. The probe is moved along the line to find the new positions of minima to the right of the original minima.
The average distance between the minima is found and the wavelength is calculated. The fraction of average shift over the wavelength is then calculated. The expected value of the fraction is $\frac{1}{4}$.
The amplitudes of the constructive and destructive interference are measured at the two positions of minima and the \it{standing wave ratio, $S$} is calculated by using Eq 1.
The amplitude reflection coefficient is then calculated from $S$ using Eq 2.

\begin{equation}
    S = \frac{A_1 + A_2}{A_1 - A_2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \rho = \frac{S-1}{S+1}
\end{equation}
