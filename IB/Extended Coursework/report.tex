    % Optimisation of tuned dampers to reduce the amplitude of resonant responses of a 3 degree of freedom structure
    In this report a model structure with 3 degrees of freedom will be hamonically excited to determine the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of the structure.
    The resonant frequnencies and mode shapes will be used to determine optimal design parameters for three seperate absorbers to reduce the resonant responses at each mode shape.
    % The optimal design parameters will be determined by using a genetic algorithm to minimise the resonant response of the structure.
    This approach can be used on real structures to reduce the amplitude of their resonant response to earthquakes.

\section{Introduction}

% Aims, Objectives and context
% context

Modern structures are designed to withstand a range of distributed static loads however they are vulnerable to harmonic excitations such as earthquakes.
The response of a structure to a harmonic excitation is determined by the resonant frequencies and mode shapes of the structure.

\subsection{Aims}

\begin{itemize}
\item To determine the resonant frequencies of a 3 degree of freedom structure
\item To determine the properties of three seperate tuned mass dampers to reduce the three resonant responses of the structure
\item To investigate the combined effect of the tuned mass dampers on the resonant response of the structure
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology and theory}
% Summary of theory and information to reproduce

The structure experimented on in this report has 3 floors stacked on top of each other connected by springs.
Resonant frequencies were determined by performing a sweep of harmonic excitations on the structure and recording the responses at each frequency.
These undamped responses were then saved and used for comparison with the responses of the structure after the addition of tuned mass dampers.

The tune mass damper model used is a simple spring-mass-damper system with a spring stiffness $k$ and damping coefficient $\lambda$.
The position of the damper is also important as it must be ideally placed at an anti node of the resonant mode shape.
For each mass spring damper the stiffness, $k$, must be tuned to match the resonant frequency of the structure.
\begin{equation}
    k = m\omega_n^2
\end{equation}
The spring used is effectively a cantilever which has a stiffness
\begin{equation}
    k = \frac{W}{\delta} = \frac{3EI}{L^3}
\end{equation}
Equating these gives the length of the cantilever as
\begin{equation}
    L = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3EI}{m\omega_n^2}}
\end{equation}
This did not however give optimal results for a variety of reasons, the main one being that the equation for deflection
of a cantilever assumes small deflections and the deflection of the tuned mass damper is significant.
The method used for tuning was to incrementally change the stiffness of the spring by changing its length until the response 
at the resonant frequency was at a minimum. 

A single mass of 50g was added to the cantilever spring and the structures response was tested with the mass at the top and slightly below.
In the 1st mode the response was worse with the mass further down and so two more 50g masses were added until the resonant response decreased.
This was done such that the optimal length lies on the cantilever for fine tuning. It can also be seen in equation (3) that increasing $m$
decreases the optimal length of the cantilever such that the tuned mass dampers resonant frequency matches that of the building.

The damping coefficient was effectively unchanged as this is caused by the viscous friction of the air on the mass.
